# ECE590_Final

This repo is for my final project in ECE590. The goal for this project is to create a 2D battle bot simulator. When the program starts, the user will select the parts they want to add to their battle bot. At completion of part selection, the battle will begin. A battle will involve their battle bot automatically moving though the displayed map and attempting to destroy the enemy battle bot. A battle ends when only one bot remains.

## Success

This project will be a success when a user is able to create their own battle bot and compete with it against other battle bots. This project will involve integration with the [ELMA](https://github.com/klavinslab/elma) manager, but will otherwise be coded from scratch in C++.

## Milestones

1. Modify ELMA to run in simulated time instead of realtime. Allows for faster testing.

1. Create base classes for battle bots, and different weapons they can use.

1. Create 2D battle map for battle bots to fight in.

1. Develop display adapter for showing the battlebots in the arena.

1. Create command prompt for accepting user inputs while building battle bot.

1. Document how to create a battle bot and run the program.

1. Turn in the project on time! March 22nd 2019
